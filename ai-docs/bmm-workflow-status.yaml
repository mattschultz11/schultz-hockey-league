# Workflow Status Template

# This tracks progress through BMM methodology Analysis, Planning, and Solutioning phases.
# Implementation phase is tracked separately in sprint-status.yaml

# STATUS DEFINITIONS:
# ==================
# Initial Status (before completion):
#   - required: Must be completed to progress
#   - optional: Can be completed but not required
#   - recommended: Strongly suggested but not required
#   - conditional: Required only if certain conditions met (e.g., if_has_ui)
#
# Completion Status:
#   - {file-path}: File created/found (e.g., "ai-docs/product-brief.md")
#   - skipped: Optional/conditional workflow that was skipped

# Purpose: Name signals a Schultz-run hockey league to convey credibility and community identity.
# Brand angle: Ownership/legacy (Schultz) + sport (hockey) + structure (league).
# user_description: Create a website for managing hockey leagues.
# Goal: Build a greenfield web app for managing hockey leagues with clear roles (admin/manager/official/player/fan); schedule + roster management; score/stat entry with validation; notifications; scheduling engine with constraints; role-based permissions; stats pipeline; backups/observability.
# Drafting: configurable draft formats (snake, linear), keepers, draft order generation with tiebreak rules, pre-draft rankings, live draft room with pick clock and auto-pick, trade review/approval, post-draft roster validation before schedule generation.
# Service Blueprint: Frontstage—admin seasons/divisions/teams, schedule builder with conflict alerts, draft room (pick clock/auto-pick/keepers), trade review/approval, manager roster+availability+lineups, officials score/penalty entry, player/fan schedules/standings/stats/notifications. Backstage—data models (season/division/team/game/player/roster), scheduling engine (venue/blackout/ref constraints), draft engine (order/tiebreaks, keeper rules, pre-draft rankings, pick validation), permissions/roles, stat pipeline (ingest→validate→publish), notification triggers (schedule/draft/trade/score), audit trail. Support—backups before drafts/schedule changes, retry/error handling for posts/notifications, observability on scheduling/draft jobs, CSV import/export for legacy data, rate limiting + auth.
