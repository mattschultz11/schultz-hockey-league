## Failed Items

- None (no ✗ items)

## Partial Items (Gaps to Address)

- Consider deferring Growth items (trades, exports, dashboards, bulk upload) for Level 2; splits done for 1.1 and 5.4 but Growth still optional.
- Enabling stories 1.3/1.4: could add even more explicit NFR/FR citations per AC if desired.
- Success metrics: per-story metrics added for high-signal items; extend to remaining stories if needed.
- Data/schema: add field-level stats payload and audit record details during architecture.
- Benchmarks: validate performance targets with staging data and update NFR budgets.

## Recommendations

1. Keep Level 2 lean: defer Growth/deferable items unless required; if kept, treat 5.4b as optional after 5.4a.
2. During architecture, add field-level specs for stats payloads and audit records; validate perf targets with measured budgets.
3. If more traceability needed, continue adding per-story metric notes for remaining stories.
